                <h2>Main Plot</h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>The Setting</h3>
                    <p>Disco Elysium takes place in the fictional district of Martinaise, a decaying coastal area in the
                        city of Revachol. The world is a unique blend of post-war depression, political turmoil, and
                        supernatural elements.</p>

                    <h3>The Mystery</h3>
                    <p>You play as a detective who wakes up with complete amnesia after a drug-and-alcohol-fueled
                        bender. Your first case: solve the murder of a man hanged from a tree in the backyard of a
                        hostel.</p>

                    <h3>Character Journey</h3>
                    <p>As you investigate, you must piece together not only the murder mystery but also your own
                        identity. Through conversations with the district's residents and your own fragmented psyche,
                        you discover who you were and who you can become.</p>

                    <h3>Themes</h3>
                    <p>The game explores deep themes of redemption, political ideology, personal identity, and the
                        nature of reality itself, all while maintaining a sharp, often humorous tone.</p>
